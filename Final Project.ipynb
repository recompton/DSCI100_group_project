    "Following our data analysis and visualization, we expect to find that as temperature and humidity levels increase, more levels of tungsten oxide will be present in the atmosphere. We also expect chemical accumulation in the atmosphere over time, resulting in a regression line with a positive slope.These findings can be useful in determining how pollutant levels change overtime and if temperature and humidity levels can be good predictors. If they are not good predictors, then there will not be a clear relationship. These findings could also lead to questions such as: If we expanded the study by year from 2004 to 2022, would a relationship be more prominent? What are the large scale effects of pollutant accumulation? Are there any other factors besides pollutant accumulation which lead to increase AH, RH or temperature?"
